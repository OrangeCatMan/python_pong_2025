Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday

[Verse 1]
I'm up and I raise my cup, singing everything is gold
Crew neck and a white blank check
I'll be moving on my own (Yo-del-lay ho)
I walked on sippin' on that love
It's another bumpy road
But I'm up and I raise my cup and I wanna take her home
(Yo-del-lay ho)

[Pre-Chorus]
I run my mouth, don't got a lot to say
Girl on fire, could burn my heart away
We are young, but we can make it rain

[Chorus]
It's thirsty, thirsty Thursday
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday



[Verse 2]
I'm up and I raise my cup, see 'em bouncin' on the floor
Perfume in a hotel room
We go bouncin' back for more (Yo-del-lay ho)
Oh, I love sippin' on that fun
It's a feeling we adore
But I'm up and I raise my cup and I wanna take her home
(Yo-del-lay ho)

[Pre-Chorus]
I run my mouth, don't got a lot to say
Girl on fire, could burn my heart away
We are young, but we can make it rain

[Chorus]
It's thirsty, thirsty Thursday
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho (Thursday)
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho (Yo-yo-yo-del-lay ho)
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday

[Bridge]
We're so thirsty
Can't no one stop me
Keep on bouncin'
Like no one's watching
We're so thirsty
Can't no one stop me
Keep on bouncin'
Like no one's watching


[Chorus]
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
(Thirsty, thirsty Thursday)
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho (We're so thirsty)
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho (Can't no one stop me)
Yo-del-lay, yo-del-lay-ee ho (Keep on bouncin')
Thirsty, thirsty Thursday
